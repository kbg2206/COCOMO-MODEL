# COCOMO-MODEL
Cocomo (Constructive Cost Model) is a regression model based on LOC, i.e number of Lines of Code. It is a procedural cost estimate model for software projects and 
is often used as a process of reliably predicting the various parameters associated with making a project such as size, effort, cost, time, and quality. 
It was proposed by Barry Boehm in 1981 and is based on the study of 63 projects, which makes it one of the best-documented models.

The key parameters which define the quality of any software products, which are also an outcome of the Cocomo are primarily Effort & Schedule:

1) Effort: Amount of labor that will be required to complete a task. It is measured in person-months units.
2) Schedule: Simply means the amount of time required for the completion of the job, which is, of course, proportional to the effort put in. 
It is measured in the units of time such as weeks, months.


Different models of Cocomo have been proposed to predict the cost estimation at different levels, based on the amount of accuracy and correctness required. 
All of these models can be applied to a variety of projects, whose characteristics determine the value of constant to be used in subsequent calculations. 

These characteristics pertaining to different system types are mentioned below. Boehm’s definition of organic, semidetached, and embedded systems:

1)Organic – A software project is said to be an organic type if the team size required is adequately small, the problem is well understood and has been solved in 
the past and also the team members have a nominal experience regarding the problem.

2)Semi-detached – A software project is said to be a Semi-detached type if the vital characteristics such as team size, experience, knowledge of the various
programming environment lie in between that of organic and Embedded. The projects classified as Semi-Detached are comparatively less familiar and difficult to 
develop compared to the organic ones and require more experience and better guidance and creativity. Eg: Compilers or different Embedded Systems 
can be consideredof Semi-Detached type.

3)Embedded – A software project requiring the highest level of complexity, creativity, and experience requirement fall under this category. 
Such software requires a larger team size than the other two models and also the developers need to be sufficiently experienced and creative to develop such 
complex models.
